What is Big O Notation?
Operation to measure the algorithms operations complexity.

Complexity time -> measure that time tha algorithms takes to be execute.
Complexity space -> measure that numbers of operation that algorithms need to be execute.

Worst Case ->When we are dealing with time and space complexity
they are three greek letter that will walk with us :
Ω - Omega , θ -Theta   O-Omicron  (Big O).

example : find a number in given array
arr = |1|,|2|,|3|,|4|,|5|,|6|,|7|

in position 0 = 1 --> The best case. we call this Omega
in position 3 = 4 --> The average case. we call this Theta
in position 6 = 7 --> The worst case. we call this Omicron

Note: Omicron (O) is always the worst case.

Type Of Big O Complexity :

0(N) -> Linear operation.

-Drop constants is always the first rule of simplification
